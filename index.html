  <h2>Artist Marketing & Publishing</h2>
  <p><strong>Spektrvm Records</strong> is shaping a new approach to publishing and marketing for independent artists.
     Rather than following traditional models, Spektrvm focuses on building innovative publishing deals designed to create secure and transparent ways for artists to be rightfully paid for their work.</p>

  <p>Through this vision, Spektrvm has collaborated with both emerging and established artists, blending creative promotion with business strategy.
     Campaigns have included blog and media coverage, digital distribution optimization, playlist pitching, and the creation of tailored press kits.
     Many of these efforts led to placements in films, television, and streaming platforms including Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu and many more.</p>

  <p>Yoaniet’s experience in artist development has extended to high-profile collaborations with artists such as <strong>Tyla Yaweh</strong>, <strong>DaniLeigh</strong>, and <strong>ILoveMakonnen</strong>, helping to expand their reach and visibility across streaming services and social media.
     By combining his role as a producer with his publishing and marketing expertise, he continues to offer artists both the sound and the strategy needed to thrive in today’s industry.</p>
